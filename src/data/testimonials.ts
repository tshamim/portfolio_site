      "Shamim did some very good work on replacing and re-designing my current website. He not only made it look cleaner and more inviting, but worked with me on integrating my podcast and a unique blog signup process.\n\nHe is clever, insightful, and delivered quality work. Plus, he's not super expensive - which is a positive. Recommend him and his work.",
